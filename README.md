I was a lasy person. So I start this project to save time in generating tasks for my students.
In this odd, brilliant and students-hating project. I tried to create assignment for every student.
And in case of cheating, I applied random module to generate different questions.
So each student will be assigned a .py file and in the file, they'll get a unique assignment.
Sorry my dearest students, I love you guys but I have a brilliant and wacko brain~hahaha 
Good luck!!
